## My Journey into Implementing a Deep Learning Library in C++

I love deep learning, and I love libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, and Pytorch, but
in order to fully understand every aspect of deep learning models, I have decided to implement
my own library from scratch. I really appreciate the freedoms Python grants the developers for
rapid prototyping; however, C++ was the first programming language I learnt, and it is very nostalgic for me.
I decided to implement this library in C++ to fully immerse myself into pure programming aspect of this project.
